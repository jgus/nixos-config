## Be Careful! ##

- Always err on the side of caution.
- Don't rush to conclusions. You don't get points for finding a broken solution quickly, you get points for finding the _right_ solution.
- When working through a problem, make sure you really understand the root cause. Don't chase the first explanation that comes to mind; carefully consider alternatives.
- Prefer safe, tested options over bleeding-edge beta code. For example, if choosing a software release, prefer the latest stable release over whatever "master" happens to be at the moment.
