## Command Permissions
- You are on nixos. Never try to install software globally. If you need to run a piece of software which is not installed, you may do so in an ephemeral shell with `nix-shell -p`.
- Remember to use `-l --no-pager` whenever calling systemctl tools (like journalctl)
- You MAY run `nixos-rebuild build` to verify changes build.
- You MAY NOT, EVER, run `nixos-rebuild switch` or `nixos-rebuild boot`.
- IF you need to test running changes, AND the user gives you EXPLICIT permission in the initial prompt, you may run `nixos-rebuild test` to test running changes.
